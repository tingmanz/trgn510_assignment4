# trgn_homework4
In this 4th week assignment, I create a program called ensg2hugo.py that takes a comma-delimited file as an argument and a column number as an input, and print a file where the Ensembl gene name has changed to a HUGO name.
## Installation & Usage
To install, use `git clone https://github.com/tingmanz/trgn_homework4.git`

A file named "ensg2hugo.py" that contains the script is necessary for the program. 
The script is generated that with a gtf file named "Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.75.gtf". This file could be downloaded to our server and within you
